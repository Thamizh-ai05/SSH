# Smart Student Hub ‚Äì VTHT_VisionED  

A centralized **Digital Platform for Comprehensive Student Activity Records** in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).  
This project was developed as part of **Smart India Hackathon 2025** under the theme **Smart Education**.

## üöÄ Problem Statement  
Traditionally, student evaluation is focused only on academics (grades, credits, degrees). However, **co-curricular and extracurricular activities** play an equally important role in holistic development but are often ignored or scattered across manual records.

## üí° Proposed Solution  
We developed **Smart Student Hub (Web + Mobile App)** ‚Äì a one-stop platform where students can:  
- Maintain **permanent academic & non-academic achievements**.  
- Get **verified profiles** acknowledged by faculty/admin.  
- Receive **badges** as motivation for active participation.  
- Access a **Chatbot** for career guidance and profile improvement.  
- View other student profiles to **inspire and collaborate**.
